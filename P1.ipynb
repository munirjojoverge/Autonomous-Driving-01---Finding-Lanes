    "# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "#  My Reflections\n",
    "The very first thing that came to my mind was \"Adaptive\" parameter estimation. The intuitive process to make the code work for the first and second videos (white and yellow) totally collapsed on the Challenge video. I found myself changing and tuning the entire set of parameters until it actually didn't fault. My conclusions in this iterative process were:\n",
    "•\tI was now clearly aware of the difficulties around this task and the safety implications around it.\n",
    "•\tI found out that my regression worked best if it was linear in the first 2 cases but quadratic was more effective for the challenge. I played with the degree on the regression until I over-fitted and was very good for the “Challenge” but horrible for the first 2 videos. Adaptive / Dynamic parameter selection kept coming to my mind\n",
    "•\tI realized how sensitive the system could be to changes on the parameters...and sensitivity is NOT a good friend of Robustness.\n",
    "•\tI realized that some of the mechanisms we use today to perform these tasks might not be the ideal ones. For instance, we all know that the roads are built for humans and not for computers and all the markings are made for humans to be able to \"see\" them. But \"seeing\" can be accomplished by a wide range of sensors using a very wide bandwidth sets. Basically, my point is that if we use a different type of cameras and not only play with the \"visual\" range of frequencies we might find that the task could be, maybe, easier...or maybe plan for the future and use a different type of lane paint or reflectors – for specific frequencies that might be robust enough to handle bad weather conditions that might scatter the emitted/reflected signal – Active vs Passive remote sensing). (all these is for other time fun discussion)\n",
    "•\tThe parameters I left for the submission/evaluation were not the optimal ones, but the ones that did work, arguably, well enough for ALL the 3 cases, including the Challenge one without having to change any parameter. \n",
    "•\tUnderstanding the exact meaning and impact of each parameter was challenging; especially when combined with the others that could produce a result that might not let you see the specific effects.\n",
    "•\tThe Challenge video proved that, even when humans might find it relatively simple to navigate, the shadows, the lack of markings, the cement Vs asphalt, the contrast created by the side barrier and the road, etc...made clear the difficultness of the task and brought back, again, the idea of building an \"Adaptive\" approach that could adjust to all these challenges and also to the changes in light due to the time of the day or due to weather...\n",
    "•\tOpenCV proved to be an excellent companion to be able to solve/develop these solutions. The problem here lays in the deep knowledge on the library itself required to use and optimize the development. I need to learn more about it.\n",
    "•\tThe “Notebook” approach is definitely rich and flexible for education purposes but it definitely makes is harder to debug.\n",
    "•\tIn general I’m satisfied with this first assignment and I think I can learn a lot from you guys. For that I’m very thankful.\n",

    "There are more things that could be added, but I beleive this is a great point to stop."
